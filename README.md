This is nothing special.  I worked on the npm workshop called thinking-in-react in order to better grasp React.
I found it amongst many other workshops on this page: https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers
and the actual thinking-in-react can be found here: https://github.com/asbjornenge/thinking-in-react
